## What Was Done (Session 1) -- Research, spec, foundation, design directions

- Research (docs/01, 03), founder Q&A (docs/02), technical spec (docs/04). Model: customer pays -> we buy from supplier (Makita SK ~48h, NTC CZ 3-5d) -> Senec branch -> tested -> courier / own transport / pickup.
- Next 16.4 scaffold, Supabase migrations, seed (`npx tsx scripts/seed.ts`, password `RoyalDemo2026!`), libs money/order-state/shipping.
- Gotchas: Windows excludes ports 54775-55351 -> 564xx. Postgres rejects `timestamptz + interval` in generated columns (deadlines via trigger). Turbopack Tailwind rule must exclude `*.module.css`.
- Decisions: one Next app (shop + /ucet + /admin); Stripe Checkout hosted, manual capture; invoices at capture; withdrawal persons only; guest checkout; numbers `OBJ26-00001`, `RK26-0001`, `OD26-0001`, credit notes `D2026NNNNN` (confirm with accountant).
